<p>Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Economics at <a href="https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/">Universidad de los Andes</a> and a Research Associate affiliated with the SDG Nexus Network at <a href="https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/zentren/zeu/sdgnexus">Justus Liebig University Giessen</a>, Germany. My research interest lies at the intersection of natural resource economics, development economics, and applied econometrics. I am particularly interested in understanding how economic agents interact with natural capital in both developed and developing country contexts.</p>

<p>In addition to my research, I also teach courses in Statistical &amp; R Programming, and Environmental and Natural Resource Economics, both at the undergraduate and graduate level at Universidad de los Andes.</p>

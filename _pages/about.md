Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Economics at [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/) and a Research Associate affiliated with the SDG Nexus Network at [Justus Liebig University Giessen](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/zentren/zeu/sdgnexus), Germany. My research interest lies at the intersection of natural resource economics, development economics, and applied econometrics. I am particularly interested in understanding how economic agents interact with natural capital in both developed and developing country contexts. 

In addition to my research, I also teach courses in Statistical & R Programming, and Environmental and Natural Resource Economics, both at the undergraduate and graduate level at Universidad de los Andes.

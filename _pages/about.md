Hello! I am a PhD candidate in economics at [MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/), where I am supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I do research in labor, political, and behavioral economics. 

I graduated from MIT in 2019 with an SB in mathematical economics and chemical-biological engineering. Before my PhD, I did research in genoeconomics at the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/). 

Outside of economics, my interests include biking at a leisurely pace, sampling hot sauces, playing violin, and listening to pop trash.

Hi! Welcome to my website. I am a PhD candidate in economics at [MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/). I do research in labor, political, and behavioral economics. My research is supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

I graduated from MIT in 2019 with an SB in mathematical economics and chemical-biological engineering. I did research in genoeconomics at the National Bureau of Economic Research before my PhD. 

Interests outside of economics include biking at a leisurely pace, sampling hot sauces, cooking, playing violin, and listening to pop trash.
